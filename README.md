<strong>WEBSYNTH</strong></br>

<strong>SUMMARY</strong></br>
This is a web based instrument that has functional harmony and an arpeggiator built in.
It is being built using the Tone.js api, javascript, html, and css.
It is loosely modeled after the AKAI MPK-mini midi controller.

<strong>HOW TO USE</strong></br>
Download the git repo, run on a local server with internet connection.
Start/stop will begin arpeggiation. 
Change key area, chord complexity, and tonality using controls on the synth body.
Change chord by clicking keys on the keyboard.

<strong>NEXT STEPS</strong></br>
- provide controls for BPM, waveform type, delay, reverb
- continue to update visual language to increase tactile feel
